		<p id="intro"> I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Mathematics, in the Arithmetic Geometry and Representation Theory <a href="https://www.math.uni-bonn.de/ag/alggeom/">group</a>. Previously, I was a student of <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~nadler/">David Nadler</a> at the University of California at Berkeley, and a Bing postdoctoral fellow at the University of Texas at Austin. 
		I am interested in higher category theory and derived algebraic and symplectic geometry.

	<h2>Research</h2>
	<ul>
		<p>
		<li><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04515">Tannaka duality and 1-affineness</a></li>
		Establishes an affineness result in the theory of sheaves of categories and applies it to Tannaka duality and to the study of relative tensor products and higher traces of &infin;-categories of quasicoherent sheaves.
		</p>
		<p>
		<li><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12925">Derived &infin;-categories as exact completions</a></li>
		Develops the theory of exact completions of regular &infin;-categories and shows that in the additive context it recovers the theory of connective derived &infin;-categories.
		</p>
		<p>
		<li><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16337">Classification of fully dualizable linear categories</a></li>
		Provides a description of the fully dualizable objects in the symmetric monoidal 2-category of cocomplete categories linear over a G-ring.
		</p>
		<p>
		<li><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11247">Derived Mellin Transform </a>  (With Tom Gannon) </li>
		This is an appendix to "Classification of nondegenerate G-categories" by Tom Gannon. Establishes an &infin;-categorical version of the Mellin transform for D-modules on a torus.
		</p>
		<p>
		<li> <a href ="Thesis.pdf">Higher Quasicoherent Sheaves</a> </li>
		My PhD thesis. The first half contains a number of results in the theory of enriched higher categories, culminating in a discussion of monads and the enriched monadicity theorem. The second half builds upon the two papers below and develops the theory of quasicoherent sheaves of (&infin;, n)-categories in derived algebraic geometry.
		</p>
		<p>
		<li> <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03027">Higher sheaf theory I: Correspondences </a> </li>
		Studies the problem of constructing representations of a higher category of correspondences. This is the first part of a series of papers that develop the theory of sheaves of higher categories in derived algebraic geometry.
		</p>
		<p>
		<li><a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.03035">Presentable (&infin;, n)-categories </a> </li> Introduces a notion of presentable higher categories, and establishes some basic technical properties that will be used in the higher sheaf theory sequence.
		</p>
	</ul>
	<h2>Other writing</h2>
	<ul>
	<p>
	<li><a href = "UBAthesis.pdf">Cohomological methods in differential equations</a></li>
	My undergraduate thesis. Studies the theory of obstructions to the formal integrability of partial differential equations and its application to the equivalence problem for G-structures.
